<h1>Assignment 11</h1>
<p><ol>
<li>What is the difference between a system font, web font, and web-safe font?</li>
  <ul>
    <li>System fonts are already installed in your system. Web fonts are hosted on a server. Web-safe fonts are fonts that a web-developer can count on being on the system.</li>
  </ul>
<li>What is the importance of having fallback fonts or a font stack?</li>
  <ul>
    <li>So that the browser knows what font to go to if it can't load the preferred font.</li>
  </ul>
<li>Free Response: Please discuss any challenges you had this week and what you did to overcome them.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>The biggest challenge for me was the fonts. I'm not sure I'm fully grasping the concepts but I want to keep trying to see if I can get my page to change the fonts. I know I need just a little bit more practice with this section. I'm excited to incorporate everything I tired this week into next week!</li>
