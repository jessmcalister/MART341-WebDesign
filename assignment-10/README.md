<h1>Assignment 10</h1>
  <p><ol>
    <li>Describe the difference between the universal, element, class, and id selector types. When might you choose one over the other to style content?</li>
      <ul>
        <li><b>universal:</b> applies to all elements in the document. <b>element:</b> This is will apply a design to an element in the HTML documents.
        <b>class:</b>Matches as element whose class attribute has a value that matches the one specified after the period (or full stop) symbol.
        <b>id:</b> matches an element whose id attribute has a value that matches the one specified after the pound or hash symbol.</li>
      </ul>
    <b><li>Briefly discuss your color palette, including the 3 colors you chose. List their color names, RGB values, or hex codes.</li></b>
      <ul>
        <li>I chose the teal, white, gray, and pink because I love those color combos. I think it's so pretty. rgb(255,0,0,0.25) , white, #ee3e80, DarkCyan. </li>
      </ul>
    <b><li><i>Free Response: Please discuss any challenges you had this week and how you overcame them.</i></li></b>
    </ol>
      <ul>
        <li>I found that the most challenging thing was to link my style.css document to my index.html document. I couldn't figure out how to get my style elements to show and it was very frustrating at first because I thought I was doing everything correctly. Then, it turns out I was not looking at the web browser view on GitHub.com. Turns out I was doing it correctly, I was just looking in the wrong place!</li>
      </ul>
