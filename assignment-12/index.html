      <h1>Yellowstone National Park</h1>
      <hr />
      <h2>Who?</h2>
        <p>President Ulysses S. Grant signed The Act of Dedication law that created Yellowstone National Park. Hayden, while not the only person to have thought of creating a park in the region, was its first and most enthusiastic advocate.</p>
        <h2>What?</h2>
          <p>Yellowstone National Park is a nearly 3,500-sq.-mile wilderness recreation area atop a volcanic hot spot. Mostly in Wyoming, the park spreads into parts of Montana and Idaho too. Yellowstone features dramatic canyons, alpine rivers, lush forests, hot springs and gushing geysers, including its most famous, Old Faithful. It's also home to hundreds of animal species, including bears, wolves, bison, elk and antelope.</p>
        <h2>Where</h2>
          <p>Yellowstone National Park is located in the western United States in Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming. One percent of the Yellowstone is located in Idaho, three percent is located in Montana, and ninety-six percent is located in the state of Wyoming.</p>
        <h2>When?</h2>
          <p>On March 1, 1872, the world's first National Park was born.</p>
        <h2>Why?</h2>
          <p>The Yellowstone Act of 1872 designated the region as a public “pleasuring-ground,” which would be preserved “from injury or spoilation, of all timber, mineral deposits, natural curiosities, or wonders within.”</p>
