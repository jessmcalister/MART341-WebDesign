  <b><li>What is the difference between padding, margin, and borders?</li></b>
    <ul>
      <li>Padding: it is the amount of space between the inner content of the element and the element itself.</li>
      <li>Margin: the space between the box/element and other elements, or the edge of the parent element.</li>
      <li>Borders: These are the lines directly around the content.</li>

      <li>The biggest challenge I faced this week was trying to figure out how to execute the float function. It was pretty difficult because I wanted to float the Yellowstone National Park symbol next to the title, but couldn't get my image to show. It was pretty frustrating because I thought it would make a great accessory piece. I also couldn't figure out how to make my "Who?", "What?", "Where?", and "Why?" title fonts bigger than the corresponding paragraphs. Every time I would try to make the titles bigger, the parapgraphs would increase in size.</li>
