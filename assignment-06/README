  <li>Describe the difference between structural and semantic markup.</li>

    <ul>
      <li>I first went through all of the content on the class website and then I proceeded with the assignment. It really helps when I go through the class module first because then, I can take as many notes as I can. It makes the assignment that much easier because I'm familiar with what the homework document is asking me to do.</li>
