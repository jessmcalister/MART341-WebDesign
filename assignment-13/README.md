<b><li>Who was your imaginary client? How did they describe their site needs?</li></b>
  <ul>
    <li>My imaginary client is myself selling different crochet goods. I wanted a site that can display the different crochet products. Obviously I missed the e-commerce piece in my website, but I wanted to show off the different products and beautiful designs of crocheting.</li>
  </ul>
<b><li>Why is it important to consider a mobile-first design?</li></b>
  <ul>
    <li>It's important because many people see things first on their smaller screen devices, like their phones. It's important to make sure that the design for that smaller screen is good and it ensures the user has a positive experience.</li>
