<h1>Assignment 9</h1>
<ol>
  <b><li>Briefly recap your experience learning HTML. What was old, new, interesting, or difficult to learn?</li></b>
    <ul>
      <li>I have experience in Visual Basic and coding an application. This is my first time coding with HTML. I find it different in the sense that the code is very different, but the thought process throughout coding is the same. Things make sense to me and I know what i need to be looking for.</li> </ul>
  <b><li>Next module we continue with CSS and expand on styling, which helps us "decorate" HTML. Is there anything you're anxious or excited to learn about in this new section?</li></b>
    <ul>
      <li>I'm excited to learn how to style a webpage using CSS. I enjoy the building blocks that HTML gives on the bones of a cite, but I enjoy design and am curious to see how it works.</li></ul>
  <b><li><i>Free Response:</i> Summarize your challenges and successes. What did you do to overcome your challenges?</li></b>
    <ul>
      <li>Last week was tough for me. I was overwhelmed with the workload of school and life as it is, but this week I feel a lot better about not only this class but my others. It's not that my workload has changed, my perspective on getting things done has.</li></ul>
