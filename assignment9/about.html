    <h1>Why Crochet?</h1>
      <p>I chose this project because I love crocheting. I find it relaxing, especially in these times we live in. It allows me to make things for my loved ones and it mean so much more to them than something I buy at the store.</p>
    <h3>What this project means for me.</h3>
      <p>My great-grandmother taught my grandmother, who taught my mom, who taught me how to crochet. This hobby has been passed down to generations in the women in my family and I want to share that if I have a little girl one day.</p>
    <h4>Why to dive deeper in crochet?</h4>
      <p>If you would like to know more about crochet, checkout YouTube channels on different stitches. Once you master the visuals, you can increase your skills with looking at different patterns on Pinterest.</p>
