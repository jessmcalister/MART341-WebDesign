<h1>Final Project</h1>
<ol>
<b><li>Did you learn anything new about web development (i.e., using GitHub, version control, repositories)?</li></b>
  <ul>
  <li>This whole course was very new to me. I didn't know anything about HTML or CSS. I knew a some about Visual Basic because I took a class a couple semester ago. This class was very easy to pick up and I really enjoyed it. THrough this project, I got to show everything I learned all semester and I was pleasantly surprised at how faster I was able to recall the skills I learned.</li>
  </ul>
<b><li>Did you learn anything new about web design (i.e., using media, color, fonts)?</li></b>
  <ul>
  <li>I learned a lot of media, color, and fonts. In this project, I learned how crucial color is because I tried a couple different colors, and some of them were very hard to see on my browser.</li>
  </ul>
<b><li>Free Response: Discuss any challenges you had and what you did to overcome them.</li></b>
  <ul>
  <li>I didn't face any challenges because all of the work that I put in in the semester really paid off in this project. I had practice doing everything before and applying it to this final project was fairly simple.</li>
  </ul>
