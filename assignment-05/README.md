<h1>The Way Back Machine</h1>
<h3>Facebook.com</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Where did you go?</b></li>
<p>I went to Facebook.com on May 29, 2006.</p>
<li><b>What did it look like?</b></li>
<p>It looks completely different than the Facebook website we see today. The login page was minimal. Only explaining within three bullet points what a user can do on Facebook.com.</p>
<li><b>How has it changed?</b></li>
Facebook has a lot more functionality than just looking up people around you, see how people know each other, and make groups and events with your friends. Now, a user can still do all of those things, but can also buy and sell on Facebook Marketplace, upload pictures for memories, and post thoughts and life milestones.</p>

<h3>My Experience with the Topics</h3>
<p>These last few topics have been fun for me. I enjoy looking through the examples of html code on the website and try to replicate them. I try to use as much new knowledge from the examples in my homework so that I can see how they work in real life. I'm still struggling with internal linking something within the Atom application. I'm struggling with linking my index.html and about.html together.

<p>This is my screenshot of my about.html page.</p>
